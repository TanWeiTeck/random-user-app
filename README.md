# UserList Web App

This project is a web application for user information. Users can view user records in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies and start the app:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
## Technologies Used

* React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive web applications.
* Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
* React-Query: A library for managing and caching API data in React.
* heroicons: A set of open-source icons designed for use with Tailwind CSS.

## How to Use

To view the user list, simply navigate to the app's homepage. From there, you can view, sort and search users.

## Future Improvements

Some potential areas for improvement in future versions of the UserList Web App include:

* Mobile responsiveness: Make the app more mobile-friendly to better support users on smaller screens.
* Column type control: Allow users to customize the types of data shown in each table column.
* Page size control: Allow users to customize the number of records shown per page.
* Sorting function: Add the ability to sort user records by criteria other than name fill.
Search function: Add the ability to search user records by criteria other than name fill..

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
